  Deep learning is an increasingly popular topic
  in the area of unsupervised learning.
  Reinforcement learning has recently adopted it
  as a value function approximation method
  that can learn from raw input
  such as image frames.
  Decent results have already been achieved
  but many problems still elude us,
  % Maybe mention POMDP
  especially where time dependencies
  must be learned in order to achieve results.

  \paragraph{}
  In this thesis,
  I explore three different neural network architectures
  and their capabilities of handling
  partially observable Markov decision processes.
  The first is the Late Fusion network
  which aims to encompass time information
  by learning from two input frames
  that correspond to different time steps.

  \forceindent
  The second is a 3D convolutional network
  which allows the network designer
  a more fine-grained control
  over how time information is merged
  throughout the network.

  \forceindent
  The last is a network
  that makes use of
  Long Short-Term Memory,
  a recurrent architecture
  especially useful for learning long-term dependencies
  of arbitrary length.
