\label{introduction}
Reinforcement Learning is what we have labelled the remarkable ability of man and beast alike 
to learn from their surroundings and their interactions with it.
It is embodied in our learning from past mistakes or our failing to do so.
For quite some time now people have attempted to bestow this same ability to 
our computing devices so that they would figure out how to tackle problems by themselves
without explicit instructions.
While the field has not been without success
it has been slow going,
crawling forward inches instead of the hoped-for leaps.

A great effort has been put forward by DeepMind with their DQN [TODO].
Through the combination of great research and sufficient computation power
their reinforcement learners have managed to beat humans
on a great array of Atari games.
Still, some games remain largely or completely unbeaten.
It is my goal to investigate their shortcomings
and supplement them with new techniques in the domain
in order to point out which direction of research
offers the most interesting insights and rewards
to further the field of Reinforcement Learning.
