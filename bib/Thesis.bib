@article{Williams1995,
abstract = {Recurrent connectionist networks are important because they can perform temporally extended tasks, giving them considerable power beyond the static mappings performed by the now-familiar multilayer feedforward networks. This ability to perform highly nonlinear dynamic mappings makes these networks particularly interesting to study and potentially quite useful in tasks that which have an independent temporal component not easily handled through the use of simple tapped delay lines. Some examples are tasks involving recognition or generation of sequential patterns and sensorimotor control. This report examines a number of learning procedures for adjusting the weights in recurrent networks in order to train such networks to produce desired temporal behaviors from input-output stream examples. The procedures are all based on the computation of the gradient of performance error with respect to network weights, and a number of strategies for computing the necessary gradient information are described. Included here are approaches which are familiar and have been first described elsewhere, along with several novel approaches. One particular purpose of this report is to provide uniform and detailed descriptions and derivations of the various techniques in order to emphasize how they relate to one another. Another important contribution of this report is a detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the various approaches discussed.},

abstract = {Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra com-putational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we de-rive a robust initialization method that particularly consid-ers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classifica-tion dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%} [29]).

abstract = {We introduce the first temporal-difference learning algorithms that converge with smooth value function approximators, such as neural networks. Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD(), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as nonlinear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al. (2009a, 2009b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. These methods can be viewed as natural generalizations to previous TD methods, as they converge to the same limit points when used with linear function approximation methods. We generalize this work to nonlinear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms, for any finite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, to a locally optimal solution. The algorithms are incremental and the computational complexity per time step scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator. Empirical results obtained in the game of Go demonstrate the algorithms effectiveness.},

abstract = {Partially observed control problems are a challenging aspect of reinforcement learning. We extend two related, model-free algorithms for continuous control -- deterministic policy gradient and stochastic value gradient -- to solve partially observed domains using recurrent neural networks trained with backpropagation through time. We demonstrate that this approach, coupled with long-short term memory is able to solve a variety of physical control problems exhibiting an assortment of memory requirements. These include the short-term integration of information from noisy sensors and the identification of system parameters, as well as long-term memory problems that require preserving information over many time steps. We also demonstrate success on a combined exploration and memory problem in the form of a simplified version of the well-known Morris water maze task. Finally, we show that our approach can deal with high-dimensional observations by learning directly from pixels. We find that recurrent deterministic and stochastic policies are able to learn similarly good solutions to these tasks, including the water maze where the agent must learn effective search strategies.},

@article{Ioffe2015,
abstract = {{Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch{\}}. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

The experimental results on Flevoland sites demonstrate the superiority of ACPSO to back-propagation (BP), adaptive BP (ABP), momentum BP (MBP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Resilient back-propagation (RPROP) methods. Moreover, the computation time for each pixel is only 1.08 × 10(-7) s.},

abstract = {This article addresses the challenge of learning to play many dierent video games with little domain- specic knowledge. Specically, it introduces a neuro-evolution approach to general Atari 2600 game playing. Four neuro-evolution algorithms were paired with three dierent state representations and evaluated on a set of 61 Atari games. The neuro-evolution agents represent dierent points along the spectrum of algorithmic sophistication - including weight evolution on topologically xed neural net- works (Conventional Neuro-evolution), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), evolution of network topology and weights (NEAT), and indirect network encoding (HyperNEAT). State representations include an object representation of the game screen, the raw pixels of the game screen, and seeded noise (a comparative baseline). Results indicate that direct-encoding methods work best on compact state representations while indirect-encoding methods (i.e. HyperNEAT) allow scaling to higher-dimensional representations (i.e. the raw game screen). Previous approaches based on temporal- dierence learning had trouble dealing with the large state spaces and sparse reward gradients often found in Atari games. Neuro-evolution ameliorates these problems and evolved policies achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing human high scores on three games. These results suggest that neuro-evolution is a promising approach to general video game playing.},

This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

abstract = {Achieving efficient and scalable exploration in complex domains poses a major challenge in reinforcement learning. While Bayesian and PAC-MDP approaches to the exploration problem offer strong formal guarantees, they are often impractical in higher dimensions due to their reliance on enumerating the state-action space. Hence, exploration in complex domains is often performed with simple epsilon-greedy methods. To achieve more efficient exploration, we develop a method for assigning exploration bonuses based on a concurrently learned model of the system dynamics. By parameterizing our learned model with a neural network, we are able to develop a scalable and efficient approach to exploration bonuses that can be applied to tasks with complex, high-dimensional state spaces. We demonstrate our approach on the task of learning to play Atari games from raw pixel inputs. In this domain, our method offers substantial improvements in exploration efficiency when compared with the standard epsilon greedy approach. As a result of our improved exploration strategy, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several games that pose a major challenge for prior methods.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63{\%} recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6{\%}) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 ({\&}gt; 65{\%}), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53{\%}).},

Second, we de-rive a robust initialization method that particularly consid-ers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classifica-tion dataset.

The approach is demonstrated for text (where the data are discrete) and online handwriting (where the data are real-valued). It is then extended to handwriting synthesis by allowing the network to condition its predictions on a text sequence. The resulting system is able to generate highly realistic cursive handwriting in a wide variety of styles.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of deep neural networks as function approximators in reinforcement learning. This paper investigates the po- tential of the DeepDeterministic PolicyGradientmethod for a robot control prob- lem both in simulation and in a real setup. The importance of the size and com- position of the experience replay database is investigated and some requirements on the distribution over the state-action space of the experiences in the database are identified. Of particular interest is the importance of negative experiences that are not close to an optimal policy. It is shown how training with samples that are insufficiently spread over the state-action space can cause the method to fail, and how maintaining the distribution over the state-action space of the samples in the experience database can greatly benefit learning.},
annote = {Paper has a good theoretical background, maybe interesting for thesis.
Takeaway: sample database needs to be and stay representative, otherwise previously learned can still be forgotten. Also interesting: Keeping oldest and newest samples works better than just twice the amount of newest samples. 

Interesting note on future work: better policy to replace samples in the db. Links to 19 and 20.

"It is shown how training with samples that are insufficiently spread over the state-action space can cause the method to fail, and how maintaining the distribution over the state-action space of the samples in the experience database can greatly benefit learning.

"When this is combined with the fact that neural networks can easily forget about data that they are no longer trained on [16], it becomes apparent that when an experience database of limited size is used, the contents should be maintained"

"Additionally, even if a network has previously learned to do a task well, it can forget this knowledge completely when learning a new task, even when the new task is related to the old one"

"Regularization can help prevent neural networks from over-fitting to their training data. However, the regularization of neural networks used for control is currently not as well understood as the reg- ularization of neural networks in other domains [17]. It is therefore important to ensure the training data in the experience database is varied enough for the neural networks to properly generalize their knowledge to the whole state-action space. A simplemethod that helps with this issue is introduced in Section 4."},

We evaluate these activation function on standard image classification task. Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart.},

In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against a baseline with a bag-of-words state representation. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline on quest completion by 54{\%} on a newly created world and by 14{\%} on a pre-existing fantasy game.},

@article{Hausknecht2015,
abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these con-trollers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each deci-sion point. To address these shortcomings, this arti-cle investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recur-rent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with in-crementally more complete observations, DRQN's per-formance scales as a function of observability. Con-versely, when trained with full observations and eval-uated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learn-ing to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},
annote = {Note: This paper contains a very good discussion on MDP/POMDP and includes nice visual reps of convolutional layers and Pong.

Exactly my first attempt at such an architecture: first post-convolutional layer is replaced with an LSTM layer.

DQRN only replicates performance and performs better on incomplete observations. Otherwise, it doesn't improve (according to Abstract).

They quote the DeepMind paper to not be able to find any games that are still only partially observable given 4 frames. However, I have a paper stating that some games need 18 frames. What's up with this?

Very nice approach to determining whether the obscured-trained DRQN can work well in non-obscured situations (to test for generalization). They do this by comparing activations between situations of p=.5 and p=1 (p=chance of obscuring). They differ only slightly, as opposed to the normal DQN.},
