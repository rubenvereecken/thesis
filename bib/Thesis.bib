In this paper we attempt to improve the under- standing of the underlying issues by explor- ing these problems from an analytical, a geo- metric and a dynamical systems perspective. Our analysis is used to justify a simple yet ef- fective solution. We propose a gradient norm clipping strategy to deal with exploding gra- dients and a soft constraint for the vanishing gradients problem.

abstract = {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausable that hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a new feature representation for first-person videos. In first-person video understanding (e.g., activity recognition), it is very important to capture both entire scene dynamics (i.e., egomotion) and salient lo-cal motion observed in videos. We describe a representa-tion framework based on time series pooling, which is de-signed to abstract short-term/long-term changes in feature descriptor elements. The idea is to keep track of how de-scriptor values are changing over time and summarize them to represent motion in the activity video. The framework is general, handling any types of per-frame feature descriptors including conventional motion descriptors like histogram of optical flows (HOF) as well as appearance descriptors from more recent convolutional neural networks (CNN). We experimentally confirm that our approach clearly outperforms previous feature representations including bag-of-visual-words and improved Fisher vector (IFV) when using identical underlying feature descriptors. We also confirm that our feature representation has superior performance to existing state-of-the-art features like local spatio-temporal features and Improved Trajectory Features (originally developed for 3rd-person videos) when handling first-person videos. Multiple first-person activity datasets were tested under various settings to confirm these findings.},

abstract = {The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether this harms performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

@article{Maei2009,
abstract = {We introduce the first temporal-difference learning algorithms that converge with smooth value function approximators, such as neural networks. Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD(), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as nonlinear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al. (2009a, 2009b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. These methods can be viewed as natural generalizations to previous TD methods, as they converge to the same limit points when used with linear function approximation methods. We generalize this work to nonlinear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms, for any finite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, to a locally optimal solution. The algorithms are incremental and the computational complexity per time step scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator. Empirical results obtained in the game of Go demonstrate the algorithms effectiveness.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

abstract = {{Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch{\}}. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9{\%} top-5 validation error (and 4.8{\%} test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing interest in the use of deep neural networks as function approximators in reinforcement learning. This paper investigates the po- tential of the DeepDeterministic PolicyGradientmethod for a robot control prob- lem both in simulation and in a real setup. The importance of the size and com- position of the experience replay database is investigated and some requirements on the distribution over the state-action space of the experiences in the database are identified. Of particular interest is the importance of negative experiences that are not close to an optimal policy. It is shown how training with samples that are insufficiently spread over the state-action space can cause the method to fail, and how maintaining the distribution over the state-action space of the samples in the experience database can greatly benefit learning.},
annote = {Paper has a good theoretical background, maybe interesting for thesis.
Takeaway: sample database needs to be and stay representative, otherwise previously learned can still be forgotten. Also interesting: Keeping oldest and newest samples works better than just twice the amount of newest samples. 

Interesting note on future work: better policy to replace samples in the db. Links to 19 and 20.

"It is shown how training with samples that are insufficiently spread over the state-action space can cause the method to fail, and how maintaining the distribution over the state-action space of the samples in the experience database can greatly benefit learning.

"When this is combined with the fact that neural networks can easily forget about data that they are no longer trained on [16], it becomes apparent that when an experience database of limited size is used, the contents should be maintained"

"Additionally, even if a network has previously learned to do a task well, it can forget this knowledge completely when learning a new task, even when the new task is related to the old one"

"Regularization can help prevent neural networks from over-fitting to their training data. However, the regularization of neural networks used for control is currently not as well understood as the reg- ularization of neural networks in other domains [17]. It is therefore important to ensure the training data in the experience database is varied enough for the neural networks to properly generalize their knowledge to the whole state-action space. A simplemethod that helps with this issue is introduced in Section 4."},

Still, many of these applications use conventional architectures, such as convolutional networks, LSTMs, or auto-encoders. In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture for model-free reinforcement learning inspired by advantage learning. Our dueling architecture represents two separate estimators: one for the state value function and one for the state-dependent action advantage function. The main benefit of this factoring is to generalize learning across actions without imposing any change to the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm. Our results show that this architecture leads to better policy evaluation in the presence of many similar-valued actions. Moreover, the dueling architecture enables our RL agent to outperform the state-of-the-art Double DQN method of van Hasselt et al. (2015) in 46 out of 57 Atari games.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the "deconvolution approach" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm concerned with learning to control a system so as to maximize a numerical performance measure that expresses a long-term objective.What distin- guishes reinforcement learning from supervised learning is that only partial feedback is given to the learner about the learner's predictions. Further, the predictions may have long term effects through influencing the future state of the controlled system. Thus, time plays a special role. The goal in reinforcement learning is to develop efficient learning algorithms, as well as to understand the al- gorithms' merits and limitations. Reinforcement learning is of great interest because of the large number of practical applications that it can be used to address, ranging from problems in artificial intelligence to operations research or control engineering. In this book,we focus on those algorithms of reinforcement learning that build on the powerful theory of dynamic programming.We give a fairly comprehensive catalog of learning problems, describe the core ideas, note a large number of state of the art algorithms, followed by the discussion of their theoretical properties and limitations.},

Incremental learning methods such as Temporal Differencing and Qlearning have fast real time performance. Classical methods are slower, but more accurate, because they make full use of the observations. Prioritized Sweeping aims for the best of both worlds. It uses all previous experiences both to prioritize important dynamic programming sweeps and to guide the exploration of state-space. We compare Prioritized Sweeping with other reinforcement learning schemes for a number of different stochastic optimal control problems. It successfully solves large state-space real time problems with which other methods have difficulty.  1 Introduction  This paper introduces a memory-based technique, prioritized sweeping, which can be used both for Markov prediction and reinforcement learning.

Metaphorically, the adaptation allows us to find needles in haystacks in the form of very predictive but rarely seen features. Our paradigm stems from recent advances in stochastic optimization and online learning which employ proximal functions to control the gradient steps of the algorithm. We describe and analyze an apparatus for adaptively modifying the proximal function, which significantly simplifies setting a learning rate and results in regret guarantees that are provably as good as the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. We give several efficient algorithms for empirical risk minimization problems with common and important regularization functions and domain constraints. We experimentally study our theoretical analysis and show that adaptive subgradient methods outperform state-of-the-art, yet non-adaptive, subgradient algorithms.},

We extend two related, model-free algorithms for continuous control -- deterministic policy gradient and stochastic value gradient -- to solve partially observed domains using recurrent neural networks trained with backpropagation through time. We demonstrate that this approach, coupled with long-short term memory is able to solve a variety of physical control problems exhibiting an assortment of memory requirements. These include the short-term integration of information from noisy sensors and the identification of system parameters, as well as long-term memory problems that require preserving information over many time steps. We also demonstrate success on a combined exploration and memory problem in the form of a simplified version of the well-known Morris water maze task. Finally, we show that our approach can deal with high-dimensional observations by learning directly from pixels. We find that recurrent deterministic and stochastic policies are able to learn similarly good solutions to these tasks, including the water maze where the agent must learn effective search strategies.},

In an interview one week later, the participants were asked to recollect stress related events through the examination of the sensor data. Although high activity levels diminished the expressiveness of the data, physicians and nurses could recall stressful events and were interested in their physiological signals. However, existing coping strategies turned out as barriers to the adoption of new tools. Future persuasive applications should focus on integration with existing coping strategies to scaffold the reflection process. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

Researchers in academic settings as well as in startup companies such as Deep Genomics, launched July 22, 2015, by some of the authors of DeepBind, will increasingly apply deep learning to genome analysis and precision medicine. The goal is to predict the effect of genetic variants— both naturally occurring and introduced by genome editing—on a cell's regulatory landscape and how this in turn affects dis-ease development. Nicole Rusk ❯❯Deep learning New computational tools learn complex motifs from large sequence data sets. A powerful form of machine learning that enables computers to solve perceptual problems such as image and speech rec-ognition is increasingly making an entry into the biological sciences. These deep-learning methods, such as deep artificial neural networks, use multiple processing layers to discover patterns and structure in very large data sets. Each layer learns a concept from the data that subsequent lay-ers build on; the higher the level, the more abstract the concepts that are learned. Deep learning does not depend on prior data processing and automatically extracts features. To use a simple example, a deep neural network tasked with interpreting shapes would learn to recognize simple edges in the first layer and then add recog-nition of the more complex shapes com-posed of those edges in subsequent lay-ers. There is no hard and fast rule for how many layers are needed to constitute deep learning, but most experts agree that more than two are required. Recent examples show the power of deep learning to derive regulatory fea-tures in genomes from DNA sequence alone: DeepSEA (Nat. Methods 12, 931– 934, 2015) uses genomic sequence as input, trains on chromatin profiles from large consortia such as ENCODE and the Epigenomics Roadmap, and predicts the effect of single-nucleotide variants on reg-ulatory regions such as DNase hypersen-sitive sites, transcription factor–binding sites and histone marks. Basset (bioRxiv, doi:10.1101/028399, 2015) uses similar deep neural networks to predict the effect of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on chromatin accessibility. DeepBind (Nat. Biotechnol. 33, 831–838, 2015) finds protein-binding sites on RNA and DNA and predicts the effects of mutations. Deep learning will be invaluable in the context of big data, as it extracts high-level information from very large volumes of data. As it gains traction in genome analy-sis, initial challenges such as overfitting due to rare dependencies in the training data},

abstract = {This article addresses the challenge of learning to play many dierent video games with little domain- specic knowledge. Specically, it introduces a neuro-evolution approach to general Atari 2600 game playing. Four neuro-evolution algorithms were paired with three dierent state representations and evaluated on a set of 61 Atari games. The neuro-evolution agents represent dierent points along the spectrum of algorithmic sophistication - including weight evolution on topologically xed neural net- works (Conventional Neuro-evolution), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), evolution of network topology and weights (NEAT), and indirect network encoding (HyperNEAT). State representations include an object representation of the game screen, the raw pixels of the game screen, and seeded noise (a comparative baseline). Results indicate that direct-encoding methods work best on compact state representations while indirect-encoding methods (i.e. HyperNEAT) allow scaling to higher-dimensional representations (i.e. the raw game screen). Previous approaches based on temporal- dierence learning had trouble dealing with the large state spaces and sparse reward gradients often found in Atari games. Neuro-evolution ameliorates these problems and evolved policies achieve state-of-the-art results, even surpassing human high scores on three games. These results suggest that neuro-evolution is a promising approach to general video game playing.},

abstract = {We consider the automated recognition of human actions in surveillance videos. Most current methods build classifiers based on complex handcrafted features computed from the raw inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a type of deep model that can act directly on the raw inputs. However, such models are currently limited to handling 2D inputs. In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models. We apply the developed models to recognize human actions in the real-world environment of airport surveillance videos, and they achieve superior performance in comparison to baseline methods.},

However, practical difficulties have been reported in training recurrent neural networks to perform tasks in which the temporal contingencies present in the input/output sequences span long intervals. We show why gradient based learning algorithms face an increasingly difficult problem as the duration of the dependencies to be captured increases. These results expose a trade-off between efficient learning by gradient descent and latching on information for long periods. Based on an understanding of this problem, alternatives to standard gradient descent are considered.},

Our experiments suggest that incorporating a non-zero slope for negative part in rectified activation units could consistently improve the results. Thus our findings are negative on the common belief that sparsity is the key of good performance in ReLU. Moreover, on small scale dataset, using deterministic negative slope or learning it are both prone to overfitting. They are not as effective as using their randomized counterpart.},

abstract = {Achieving efficient and scalable exploration in complex domains poses a major challenge in reinforcement learning. While Bayesian and PAC-MDP approaches to the exploration problem offer strong formal guarantees, they are often impractical in higher dimensions due to their reliance on enumerating the state-action space. Hence, exploration in complex domains is often performed with simple epsilon-greedy methods. To achieve more efficient exploration, we develop a method for assigning exploration bonuses based on a concurrently learned model of the system dynamics. By parameterizing our learned model with a neural network, we are able to develop a scalable and efficient approach to exploration bonuses that can be applied to tasks with complex, high-dimensional state spaces. We demonstrate our approach on the task of learning to play Atari games from raw pixel inputs. In this domain, our method offers substantial improvements in exploration efficiency when compared with the standard epsilon greedy approach. As a result of our improved exploration strategy, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art results on several games that pose a major challenge for prior methods.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In many recent object recognition systems, feature extraction stages are generally composed of a filter bank, a non-linear transformation, and some sort of feature pooling layer. Most systems use only one stage of feature extraction in which the filters are hard-wired, or two stages where the filters in one or both stages are learned in supervised or unsupervised mode. This paper addresses three questions: 1. How does the non-linearities that follow the filter banks influence the recognition accuracy? 2. does learning the filter banks in an unsupervised or supervised manner improve the performance over random filters or hardwired filters? 3. Is there any advantage to using an architecture with two stages of feature extraction, rather than one? We show that using non-linearities that include rectification and local contrast normalization is the single most important ingredient for good accuracy on object recognition benchmarks. We show that two stages of feature extraction yield better accuracy than one. Most surprisingly, we show that a two-stage system with random filters can yield almost 63{\%} recognition rate on Caltech-101, provided that the proper non-linearities and pooling layers are used. Finally, we show that with supervised refinement, the system achieves state-of-the-art performance on NORB dataset (5.6{\%}) and unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised refinement produces good accuracy on Caltech-101 ({\&}gt; 65{\%}), and the lowest known error rate on the undistorted, unprocessed MNIST dataset (0.53{\%}).},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning is a type of unsupervised learning for sequential decision making. Qlearning is probably the best-understood reinforcement learning algorithm. In Q-learning, the agent learns a mapping from states and actions to their utilities. An important assumption of Q-learning is the Markovian environment assumption, meaning that any information needed to determine the optimal actions is reflected in the agent's state representation. Consider an agent whose state representation is based solely on its immediate perceptual sensations. When its sensors are not able to make essential distinctions among world states, the Markov assumption is violated, causing a problem called perceptual aliasing. For example, when facing a closed box, an agent based on its current visual sensation cannot act optimally if the optimal action depends on the contents of the box. There are two basic approaches to addressing this problem-- using more sensors or using history to figure out the current world state. This paper studies three connectionist approaches which learn to use history to handle perceptual aliasing: the window-Q, recurrent-Q and recurrent-model architectures. Empirical study of these architectures is presented. Their relative strengths and weaknesses are also discussed.},

The challenge is to capture the complementary information on appearance from still frames and motion between frames. We also aim to incorporate into the network design aspects of the best performing hand-crafted features. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we propose a two-stream ConvNet architecture which incorporates spatial and temporal networks. Second, we demonstrate that a ConvNet trained on multi-frame dense optical flow is able to achieve very good performance in spite of limited training data. Finally, we show that multi-task learning, applied to two different action classification datasets, can be used to increase the amount of training data and improve the performance on both. Our architecture is trained and evaluated on the standard video actions benchmarks of UCF-101 and HMDB-51, where it matches the state of the art. It also exceeds by a large margin previous attempts to use deep nets for video classification.},

@article{Hausknecht2015,
abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has yielded proficient controllers for complex tasks. However, these con-trollers have limited memory and rely on being able to perceive the complete game screen at each deci-sion point. To address these shortcomings, this arti-cle investigates the effects of adding recurrency to a Deep Q-Network (DQN) by replacing the first post-convolutional fully-connected layer with a recur-rent LSTM. The resulting Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN), although capable of seeing only a single frame at each timestep, successfully integrates information through time and replicates DQN's performance on standard Atari games and partially observed equivalents featuring flickering game screens. Additionally, when trained with partial observations and evaluated with in-crementally more complete observations, DRQN's per-formance scales as a function of observability. Con-versely, when trained with full observations and eval-uated with partial observations, DRQN's performance degrades less than DQN's. Thus, given the same length of history, recurrency is a viable alternative to stacking a history of frames in the DQN's input layer and while recurrency confers no systematic advantage when learn-ing to play the game, the recurrent net can better adapt at evaluation time if the quality of observations changes.},
annote = {There are btw two ways of doing updates.
They stick to one in this paper but explain both

Extra for LSTM: gradients clipped to 10 for stability

Rectifier layer after LSTM reduced performance

Note: This paper contains a very good discussion on MDP/POMDP and includes nice visual reps of convolutional layers and Pong.

Exactly my first attempt at such an architecture: first post-convolutional layer is replaced with an LSTM layer.

DQRN only replicates performance and performs better on incomplete observations. Otherwise, it doesn't improve (according to Abstract).

They quote the DeepMind paper to not be able to find any games that are still only partially observable given 4 frames. However, I have a paper stating that some games need 18 frames. What's up with this?

Very nice approach to determining whether the obscured-trained DRQN can work well in non-obscured situations (to test for generalization). They do this by comparing activations between situations of p=.5 and p=1 (p=chance of obscuring). They differ only slightly, as opposed to the normal DQN.},

In these games, all interactions in the virtual world are through text and the underlying state is not observed. The resulting language barrier makes such environments challenging for automatic game players. We employ a deep reinforcement learning framework to jointly learn state representations and action policies using game rewards as feedback. This framework enables us to map text descriptions into vector representations that capture the semantics of the game states. We evaluate our approach on two game worlds, comparing against a baseline with a bag-of-words state representation. Our algorithm outperforms the baseline on quest completion by 54{\%} on a newly created world and by 14{\%} on a pre-existing fantasy game.},

abstract = {While logistic sigmoid neurons are more biologically plausable that hyperbolic tangent neurons, the latter work better for training multi-layer neural networks. This paper shows that rectifying neurons are an even better model of biological neurons and yield equal or better performance than hyperbolic tangent networks in spite of the hard non-linearity and non-differentiability at zero, creating sparse representations with true zeros, which seem remarkably suitable for naturally sparse data. Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabelled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labelled data sets. Hence, these results can be seen as a new milestone in the attempts at understanding the difficulty in training deep but purely supervised nueral networks, and closing the performance gap between neural networks learnt with and without unsupervised pre-training},

The experimental results on Flevoland sites demonstrate the superiority of ACPSO to back-propagation (BP), adaptive BP (ABP), momentum BP (MBP), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Resilient back-propagation (RPROP) methods.

abstract = {Recurrent connectionist networks are important because they can perform temporally extended tasks, giving them considerable power beyond the static mappings performed by the now-familiar multilayer feedforward networks. This ability to perform highly nonlinear dynamic mappings makes these networks particularly interesting to study and potentially quite useful in tasks that which have an independent temporal component not easily handled through the use of simple tapped delay lines. Some examples are tasks involving recognition or generation of sequential patterns and sensorimotor control. This report examines a number of learning procedures for adjusting the weights in recurrent networks in order to train such networks to produce desired temporal behaviors from input-output stream examples. The procedures are all based on the computation of the gradient of performance error with respect to network weights, and a number of strategies for computing the necessary gradient information are described. Included here are approaches which are familiar and have been first described elsewhere, along with several novel approaches. One particular purpose of this report is to provide uniform and detailed descriptions and derivations of the various techniques in order to emphasize how they relate to one another. Another important contribution of this report is a detailed analysis of the computational requirements of the various approaches discussed.},
