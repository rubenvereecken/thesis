abstract = {Several researchers have proposed modeling temporally abstract actions in reinforcement learning by the combination of a policy and a ter- mination condition, which we refer to as an op- tion. Value functions over options and models of options can be learned using methods designed for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). However, all these methods require an option to be executed to termination. In this paper we ex- plore methods that learn about an option from small fragments of experience consistent with that option, even if the option itself is not exe- cuted. We call these methods intra-option learn- ing methods because they learn from experience within an option. Intra-option methods are some- times much more efficient than SMDP meth- ods because they can use off-policy temporal- difference mechanisms to learn simultaneously about all the options consistent with an expe- rience, not just the few that were actually exe- cuted. In this paper we present intra-option learn- ing methods for learning value functions over op- tions and for learning multi-time models of the consequences of options. We present compu- tational examples in which these new methods learn much faster than SMDP methods and learn effectively when SMDP methods cannot learn at all. We also sketch a convergence proof for intra- option value learning.},

annote = {Their results are better than native Q-learning or Sarsa. Main advantage seems to be that you can better use your experience. It mentions that it's better than some batch learning method.

According to Peter this paper's technique is used by DeepMind. 
He also suggests tracking trajectories could be an interesting extension since recurrent architectures always work with trajectories.},

@article{Mnih2015,
abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

@article{Yao2014,
abstract = {We consider the problem of learning models of options for real-time abstract planning, in the setting where reward functions can be specified at any time and their expected returns must be efficiently computed. We introduce a new model for an option that is independent of any reward function, called the universal option model (UOM). We prove that the UOM of an option can construct a traditional option model given a reward function, and also supports efficient computation of the option-conditional return. We extend the UOM to linear function approximation, and we show the UOM gives the TD solution of option returns and the value function of a policy over options. We provide a stochastic approximation algorithm for incrementally learning UOMs from data and prove its consistency. We demonstrate our method in two domains. The first domain is a real-time strategy game, where the controller must select the best game unit to accomplish a dynamically-specified task. The second domain is article recommendation, where each user query defines a new reward function and an article's relevance is the expected return from following a policy that follows the citations between articles. Our experiments show that UOMs are substantially more efficient than previously known methods for evaluating option returns and policies over options.},

@article{Gabel2011,
abstract = {Neural batch reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently shown to be a powerful tool for model-free reinforcement learning problems. In this paper, we present a novel learning benchmark from the realm of computer games and apply a variant of a neural batch RL algorithm in the scope of this benchmark. Defining the learning problem and appropriately adjusting all relevant parameters is often a tedious task for the researcher who implements and investigates some learning approach. In RL, the suitable choice of the function c of immediate costs is crucial, and, when utilizing multi-layer perceptron neural networks for the purpose of value function approximation, the definition of c must be well aligned with the specific characteristics of this type of function approximator. Determining this alignment is especially tricky, when no a priori knowledge about the task and, hence, about optimal policies is available. To this end, we propose a simple, but effective dynamic scaling heuristic that can be seamlessly integrated into contemporary neural batch RL algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of this heuristic in the context of the well-known pole swing-up benchmark as well as in the context of the novel gaming benchmark we are suggesting.},

@article{Silver2008,
abstract = {We present a reinforcement learning architecture, Dyna-2, that encompasses both sample-based learning and sample-based search, and that generalises across states during both learning and search. We apply Dyna-2 to high performance Computer Go. In this domain the most successful planning methods are based on sample-based search algorithms, such as UCT, in which states are treated individually, and the most successful learning methods are based on temporal-difference learning algorithms, such as Sarsa, in which linear function approximation is used. In both cases, an estimate of the value function is formed, but in the first case it is transient, computed and then discarded after each move, whereas in the second case it is more permanent, slowly accumulating over many moves and games. The idea of Dyna-2 is for the transient planning memory and the permanent learning memory to remain separate, but for both to be based on linear function approximation and both to be updated by Sarsa. To apply Dyna-2 to 9x9 Computer Go, we use a million binary features in the function approximator, based on templates matching small fragments of the board. Using only the transient memory, Dyna-2 performed at least as well as UCT. Using both memories combined, it significantly outperformed UCT. Our program based on Dyna-2 achieved a higher rating on the Computer Go Online Server than any handcrafted or traditional search based program.},
