\end{tabularx}
\paragraph{}
  The values in this table are based entirely on the DQN implementation by
  \cite{Mnih2013},
  except for those annotated.

  * The original implementation uses no initial no-ops.
  This is added in to add some stochasticity to the games.

  ** The original implementation crops out the required area from a frame.
  This does not generalize well to games where important information
  falls outside of this frame.

The rest of the parameters not present here are as supplied by Table \ref{tab:base}.
The combination in this table is gotten from \cite{Mnih2015},
which tended to work well for some games and considerably sped up training
because less updates are performed.

It is however sufficient for comparisons.

  \hline
nonlinearity & tanh & Nonlinearity applied to output \\
gradient clipping & 10 & Gradients are clipped to 10 \\
\end{tabularx}

\paragraph{}
All gates are constructed with all weights initialized randomly
according to a normal distribution with standard deviation $0.1$.
They all apply a sigmoid nonlinearity to their output.

The cell state unit has its weights initialized likewise
except for the cell state value which gets initialized to 0.
A tanh nonlinearity is applied to the output of this unit.

\begin{table}[]
  \paragraph{}
  Each experiment is run 3 times
  except the basic DQN experiments which are all run 5 times
  (no matter whether 1 or 4 frames as input).
  An experiment is run over 100 epochs of each 50000 steps.
  After each epoch a test phase takes place to calculate gathered rewards
  over 10000 steps.
  These are then averaged and represent a single point.
  The average Q-values are calculated over 3200 states
  that are randomly gathered at the start of the experiment.

  \paragraph{}
  Where rewards or average Q-values are illustrated in a graph,
  the graph is smoothed with a weighted running average
  with a window of 5
  to increase visibility.

  \paragraph{}
  Where the Wilcoxon signed-rank test is applied,
  it tests the null hypothesis that the samples
  are drawn from the same distribution.
