\chapter{Deep Learning}
Neural networks have on and off
been a hot topic in machine learning and reinforcement learning.
Using them with off-policy learning like Q-learning
is dangerous because there are no convergence guarantees,
in fact in practice they tend to diverge.
This made linear learners the superior choice
for use with Q-learning
because of their convergence guarantees.

Deep Reinforcement Learning has mediated these problems
and has managed to deliver a learner
that learns end-to-end,
from high-dimensional output such as an image
to Q-values.
